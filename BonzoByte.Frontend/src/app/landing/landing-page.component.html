<h5>What is Bonzobyte?</h5>
<p>
    Bonzobyte is an independent tennis analytics platform built with one goal in mind: to provide the most detailed and accurate insights into matches, players, and performance â€“ all driven by real data and custom-built models.

<h5>What makes it different?</h5>
<p>
    Instead of surface-level stats, Bonzobyte uses our own neural networks, Bayesian ranking models, and custom implementations of TrueSkill to generate predictive analytics and player evaluation metrics. All match data is hand-cleaned, structured and compressed for efficiency.

<h5>Why we built it</h5>
<p>
    This project began as a passion for tennis and technology â€“ a hobby that grew into a serious engineering effort. Bonzobyte is not a commercial product; it's a living, evolving project that reflects our curiosity, discipline, and love for the sport.
